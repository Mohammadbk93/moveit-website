# Moveit Website ðŸšš

This is a **frontend-only website** built entirely with **Bootstrap 5.3**, as a personal project to practice and showcase my **frontend development skills**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ About the Project

This project is based on an **imaginary startup** called _Moveit_, which offers modern and user-friendly moving services in Italy.

The goal of this website was:
- To build a **responsive** and **professional-looking UI** using only Bootstrap components
- To simulate a **real-world landing page** for a service-based company
- To practice using features like **navbars, dropdowns, grids, buttons, cards, and layout utilities**

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- Bootstrap 5.3  
- CSS (basic custom styling)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This website was not made for a real company â€” it's a **fictional brand and design** created entirely as a frontend exercise.  
It helped me improve my layout, styling, and UI organization skills using Bootstrap only.
